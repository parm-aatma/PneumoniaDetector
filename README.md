# PneumoniaDetector
Built on Kaggle Kernel. It took me around 15 minutes to train it with Kaggle's GPUs.
I used transfer learning for this. The model used is VGG16.
The image was scaled down to (256,256) in order to ease the training time but it definately would have affected the accuracy. The accuracy after the tenth epoch was around 90%.
Couldn't upload the trained model due to size restriction.
